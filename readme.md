# About me

Hi! My name is Victor Tereschenko.

# My experience

## 2022-current

I do participate in amateur car racing. And I found a problem: most of the organizers fails to calculate results right. And it's completely unclear 
what place you are on. So, I developed an MVP for local time attack event. The old people quit and the new time attack organizers team refused to use it.
I added support of autocross events. But still little to no interest in such software. I've added support of competition grid for Drift. And now
it used by local drifters for judging, competition grid generation and providing viewers/entrees with event information. Currently under active development.
You can take a look at it [here](https://tart.bmirussian.ru/).

Used stack: dotnet core 8, webapi, EntityFramework, postgresql, blazor, signalR, telegram bot.

## 2018-current Developer of Trade Script Convertor

It grown up from Upwork development. There were a lot of tasks for PineScript to MQL4/5 conversions. So, I wrote a parser of PineScript 
+ generators to MQL4/5/Lua. Rewrote it 3 times already (after figuring out that I chose the architecture incorrectly 
and I need a completely different approach). I do sell it for another developers of trading indicators and robots. The biggest project of mine.
2.5K of acceptance and unit tests. Available at [https://convertor.profitrobots.com/](https://convertor.profitrobots.com/)

Used stack: dotnet core 8, webapi, EntityFramework, postgresql, blazor.

## 2015-current Indicators/strategies developer on fxcodebase.com

From time to time I took some interesting indicators/strategies development on Lua/MQL4/MQL5 from fxcodebase.com as a hobby project. 

## 2017-current Founder of ProfitRobots.com

It grown up from Upwork development. I noticed that most of the customers asking for the same thing. I tried to develop a strategy generator. 
But it was a dead-end, so I dropped the project. But started to offer Telegram notifications for trading platforms (mainly TradingView). 
Surprisengly, people liked that and event start to pay money for that. I extended support for MetaTrader 4/5 and FXTS2, as well as Discord bot. 
The project goes offline in 2022 because of deletion of my Microsoft account. I was too busy in Gehtsoft, so I had no time to rewrite it from 
AzureDB to postgresql. Now the project is partly recovered, but it's not that popular any more (in 2022 it had 38K of users and telegram channels).
I do plan to make that open source when I'll have some free time. Now it's a hobby project of mine.

Used stack: dotnet core 8, webapi, EntityFramework, postgresql, AzureDB, docker, telegram bot, discord bot, chrome extensions, javascript.

## Feb 2024-Jul 2024 C# backend developer in Lesasoft

Old colleagues of my called me to help with the project. The hired backend developer didn't manage to do the job, so I was hired to do his work instead.

was closed.

## Sep 2020-Jun 2023 C++ Developer in Gehtsoft

Old colleagues of my call me back to Gehtsoft. My task was to improve stability of ForexConnect (multi-platform trading API which comes 
as a replacement to Order2Go I used to work on) on mobile platforms. And help mobile developers to do charting on Android and iOS, 
as well as help with Lua scripting on these platforms. Later on I switched back to FXTS2 desktop platform: add new source of ticks 
and do a major architecture redesign. Burned out in the end, and quit development for almost 5 months.

## Jul 2017-Sep 2020 Freelancer on Upwork

It turned out that there are a lot of indicator/strategy development tasks for FXTS2 platform. I'm the one who integrated scripting into FXTS2, so
I do know how it works better than anyone else. And I can do these tasks really well and fast. And can ask high hourly rate and still be cheaper that 
anyone else. So, I switched to Upwork, doing indicators and strategies on Lua. I added MQL4/5 for Metatrader, NinjaScript 7/8 for NinjaTrader 
and PineScript for TradingView as well. I developed a number of templates for faster development of typical projects: 
[MQL5](https://github.com/sibvic/mq5-templates), [MQL4](https://github.com/sibvic/mq4-templates), [FXTS2 Lua](https://github.com/sibvic/fxts2-templates),
[PineScript](https://github.com/sibvic/pinescript-templates), [NinjaScrip 8](https://github.com/sibvic/nt8-templates),
